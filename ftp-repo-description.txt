OpenGDC repository
-------------------

The open access FTP repository (ftp://bioinformatics.iasi.cnr.it/opengdc/) contains the original TCGA datasets
processed by OpenGDC and the corresponding data converted into the BED format.

The repository is composed of two main folders: "bed" and "original".
Both the directories have the same subdirectory organisation. They contain a set of folders named with the program tag (e.g.: "tcga").
Each program contains a set of folders named with the tumor tag and, for each of them, a subdirectory for each data type.
Each tumor folder includes a set of directories, each for a specific data type and accordingly named, containing all the
available genomic and clinical data, i.e.:

 (i)     clinical_and_biospecimen_supplements
 (ii)    copy_number_segment
 (iii)   gene_expression_quantification
 (iv)    isoform_expression_quantification
 (v)     masked_copy_number_segment
 (vi)    masked_somatic_mutation
 (vii)   methylation_beta_value
 (viii)  mirna_expression_quantification


The following tree directory structure represents the organisation of the OpenGDC repository:

The "original" folder contains all the public available genomic and clinical data about 33 different tumors retrieved
from the Genomic Data Commons repository.

On the other hand, the "bed" folder contains the same data stored in the "original" directory converted in BED format
with regard to the genomic experiments, and META format for the clinical and biospecimen supplements.
It additionally includes a comma separated values (CSV) file containing the occurrences of all the meta data attributes related
to the tumor type ("meta2disease_table.csv") for the specific program.
Each tumor folder includes:
 
 (i)    a text file including the meta data dictionary of the tumor ("meta_dictionary_[tumor-tag].txt")
 (ii)   a CSV file containing the occurrence counts of each meta data attribute related to the tumor ("meta2dataType_table.csv")
 (iii)  a CSV file containing a table with a list of all meta data attributes concatenated with all possible values on the rows 
        and the list of all available data types for the considered tumor; a generic cell of this table contains the occurrences 
        of the pair attribute|value in a specific data type ("meta_values2dataType.csv")
 (iv)   a tab separated values (TSV) file containing a list of all meta data attributes concatenated with all possible 
        values followed by the occurrences of this pair(attribute|value) in all data types for the considered tumor 
        ("meta_values2sample.tsv")


Finally, each experiment folder contains:

 (i)    a set of files in BED format (one for each aliquot) with the corresponding META files that
        includes the clinical and biospecimen information about the related sample
 (ii)   the header.schema file that defines the structure of the .bed files
 (iii)  the meta_dictionary.txt file with all the clinical and biospecimen attributes and values related to the experiment
 (iv)   the text file exp_info.tsv that reports the patient, sample and aliquot counts
 (v)    the md5checksum.txt with the results of the MD5 hash function applied to all the BED and META files to guarantee their 
        integrity
